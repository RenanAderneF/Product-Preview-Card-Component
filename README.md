# Product Preview Card Component 

A responsive card component made using flexbox 

This project was made to put my knowledge of HTML and CSS to work. The main goal of this challenge was to get better at doing responsive projects. The key components for solution were:

* Using Flexbox properties to align, position and order elements with ease
* Using the picture tag and media queries to define unique styles for diferent devices

## Some insights while doing this project

At first, i used the background image property for the perfume image, since it was the only way i knew of sizing and centering an image in a div. Since the background image property is discouraged to be used for images with semantic value, i decided to not go for it. Although there's some things to improve, i'm quite happy with the result.
